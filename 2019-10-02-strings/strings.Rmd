# Thanks to our sponsors `r emo::ji("pretzel")`
```{r, out.width = "550px", fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/jr.png")
```

---

# stringr

To access the datasets, help pages, and functions that we will use tonight, load the stringr by running this code:

```{r install tidyverse, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("stringr")
```

```{r load libraries, message=FALSE}
library("stringr")
```

```{r, out.width = "250px", fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/stringr.png")
```

# **stringr** - stringr manipulation

* Handling text in data sets can be challenging
* Typical problems include
  * Extra whitespace
  * Incorrectly capitalised names
  * Poor spelling

* **stringr** has lots of tools to deal with strings

* RStudio has provided a [cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/strings.pdf)

---

# Subsetting strings

We first need to load **stringr** and we also need basic string to practice on 

```{r chapter3-2, message = FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
review = "The food was delicious"
```

The function `str_sub()` gives us a handy way to extract characters 

```{r chapter3-3}
str_sub(review, 5, 8)
```

---

# Subsetting strings

* Positive integers count from the left
* Negative integers count from the right 

```{r chapter3-4}
str_sub(review, -9, -1)
```

We can also use this to modify strings

```{r chapter3-5}
str_sub(review, -9, -1) = "awful"
review
```

---

# Replacing strings

* Use `str_replace()` to match and replace patterns 

```{r chapter3-6}
str_replace(review, pattern = "food", 
            replacement = "service")
```

---
# Detecting strings

* If we have a vector of strings, we can look for patterns within each string

```{r chapter3-7}
review = c("The food was delicious", 
           "The staff were unhelpful", 
           "The service was ok")

str_detect(review, "delicious")
str_which(review, "delicious")
str_subset(review, "delicious")
```

---

# str_extract

* `str_extract()` returns a vector with the pattern

```{r str_which}
str_extract(review, "unhelpful")
```


---

# String length

* We can find the length of a string with `str_length()` 
```{r chapter3-11}
str_length(review)
```

* Note that this function counts whitespace

---

# Dealing with whitespace

* Whitespace can be a pain when working with strings.

```{r chapter3-12}
names = c("John", "Abby", " Thomas", " Zak")
str_sort(names)
```

* The string has been sorted incorrectly due to the whitespace.
*  We can use `str_trim()` to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from strings. 

```{r chapter3-13}
names %>% 
  str_trim() %>% 
  str_sort()
```
---

# Squish!

* We can also trim excessive whitespace within a string, using `str_squish()`. 
```{r chapter3-14}
bond = c("    James      Bond     ")
str_squish(bond)
```

* Notice this also trims leading and trailing whitespace.

---

# Case transformation 

* `str_to_upper()` converts all to upper
* `str_to_lower()` converts all to lower
* `str_to_title()` capitalises the first character of each word

```{r chapter3-15}
str_to_upper(names)
str_to_lower(names)
```

```{r chapter3-16}
bad_names = c("JONATHON butterwood", "colin BATTERSEY")
str_to_title(bad_names)
```

---

# Excercises

1. In code that doesn’t use stringr, you’ll often see `paste()` and `paste0()`. What’s the difference between the two functions? What stringr function are they equivalent to? How do the functions differ in their handling of NA? What about `glue()`?

2. In your own words, describe the difference between the sep and collapse arguments to `str_c()`.

3. Use `str_length()` and `str_sub()` to extract the middle character from a string. What will you do if the string has an even number of characters?

4. What does `str_wrap()` do? When might you want to use it?

---

# Regular Expressions

* General language to describe patterns in strings.

*  Practice with `str_view()` 

```{r}
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_view(x, "an")
```

---

# Any character `.`

The next step up in complexity is `.`, which matches any character (except a newline):

```{r}
str_view(x, ".a.")
```

---

# Escape!

* How do we search for a literal dot `.` ?
* `\` is the character to escape 
* In R, we need to type two backslashes in a string.
* Therefore to search for a dot we need to use `\\.`

For example, to find the phrase `a.c`

```{r}
str_view(c("abc", "a.c", "bef"), "a\\.c")
```

---

# Escape escape!

* How do we search for a backslash `\`?
* Well we need to escape it.
* `\\\\`


```{r}
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear", "plum\\peach")
str_view(x, "\\\\")
```

---

# Anchors `r emo::ji("anchor")`

* By default, regular expressions will match any part of a string.
* We can anchor the regular expression to match from the start or end of the string. 
* `^` to match the start of the string.

```{r}
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_view(x, "^a")
```

---

# Anchors `r emo::ji("anchor")`

* By default, regular expressions will match any part of a string.
* We can anchor the regular expression to match from the start or end of the string. 
* `$` to match the end of the string.

```{r}
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_view(x, "a$")
```

---

# Anchors `r emo::ji("anchor")`

* Putting it all together
* Use both `^` and `$`

```{r}
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_view(x, "^apple$")
```

---

# Character classes

There are a number of special patterns that match more than one character.You’ve already seen `.`, which matches any character apart from a newline. 

* `\d`: matches any digit.
* `\s:` matches any whitespace (e.g. space, tab, newline).
* `[abc]`: matches a, b, or c.
* `[^abc]`: matches anything except a, b, or c.

Remember, to create a regular expression containing `\d` or `\s`, you’ll need to escape the `\` for the string, so you’ll type `\\d` or `\\s`.

---

# Repetition

We can also look for how many times a pattern matches:

* ?: 0 or 1
* +: 1 or more
* *: 0 or more
* {n}: exactly n
* {n, }: n or more
* {, m}: at most m
* {n, m}: between n and m

```{r}
x <- c("colour", "color", "colours")
str_view(x, "colo(u)?r")
```

---

# Grouping and backreferences

```{r}
str_view(fruit, "(..)\\1", match = TRUE)
```

---

# Excercises

Using `stringr::words`, create regular expressions that find all words that:

1. Start with “y”.
2. End with “x”
3. Are exactly three letters long. (Don’t cheat by using `str_length()`!)
4. Have seven letters or more.
5. Start with a vowel.
6. That only contain consonants. (Hint: thinking about matching “not” - vowels.)
7. End with ed, but not with eed.
8. End with ing or ise.
9. Contains consecutive triple vowels. (e.g "iou")

Since this list is long, you might want to use the match argument to `str_view()` to show only the matching or non-matching words. E.g. 

```{r}
str_view(words, pattern = "an", match = TRUE)
```
