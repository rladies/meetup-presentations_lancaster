# Tonight

* **stringr** package
* An introduction to regular expressions (Regex)

### Slides `r emo::ji("teacher")`     [github.com/rladies](https://github.com/rladies/)

### Book chapter `r emo::ji("book")`     [r4ds.had.co.nz](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html)

# Thanks to our sponsors `r emo::ji("pretzel")`
```{r, out.width = "550px", fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/jr.png")
```

---

# stringr

To access the datasets, help pages, and functions that we will use tonight, load the stringr by running this code:

```{r install tidyverse, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("stringr")
```

```{r load libraries, message=FALSE}
library("stringr")
```

```{r, out.width = "250px", fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/stringr.png")
```

---

# **stringr** - stringr manipulation

* Handling text in data sets can be challenging
* Typical problems include
  * Extra whitespace
  * Incorrectly capitalised names
  * Poor spelling

* **stringr** has lots of tools to deal with strings

* RStudio has provided a [cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/strings.pdf)

---

# String length

We first need to load **stringr** and we also need basic string to practice on 

```{r chapter3-2, message = FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
review = "The food was delicious"
```


* We can find the length of a string with `str_length()` 
```{r chapter3-11}
str_length(review)
```

* Note that this function counts whitespace

---

# Subsetting strings


The function `str_sub()` gives us a handy way to extract characters 

```{r chapter3-3}
str_sub(review, 5, 8)
```

---

# Subsetting strings

* Positive integers count from the left
* Negative integers count from the right 

```{r chapter3-4}
str_sub(review, -9, -1)
```

We can also use this to modify strings

```{r chapter3-5}
str_sub(review, -9, -1) = "awful"
review
```

---

# Replacing strings

* Use `str_replace_all()` to match and replace patterns 

```{r chapter3-6}
str_replace_all(review, pattern = "food", 
            replacement = "service")
```

---
# Detecting strings

* If we have a vector of strings, we can look for patterns within each string

```{r chapter3-7}
review = c("The food was delicious", 
           "The staff were unhelpful", 
           "The service was ok")

str_detect(review, "delicious")
str_which(review, "delicious")
str_subset(review, "delicious")
```

---

# Dealing with whitespace

* Whitespace can be a pain when working with strings.

```{r chapter3-12}
names = c("John", "Abby", " Thomas", " Zak")
str_sort(names)
```

* The string has been sorted incorrectly due to the whitespace.
*  We can use `str_trim()` to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from strings. 

```{r chapter3-13}
names %>% 
  str_trim() %>% 
  str_sort()
```
---

# Squish!

* We can also trim excessive whitespace within a string, using `str_squish()`. 
```{r chapter3-14}
bond = c("    James      Bond     ")
str_squish(bond)
```

* Notice this also trims leading and trailing whitespace.

---

# Case transformation 

* `str_to_upper()` converts all to upper
* `str_to_lower()` converts all to lower
* `str_to_title()` capitalises the first character of each word

```{r chapter3-15}
str_to_upper(names)
str_to_lower(names)
```

```{r chapter3-16}
bad_names = c("JONATHON butterwood", "colin BATTERSEY")
str_to_title(bad_names)
```

---

# Exercises

1. Set `longword = "Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch"`

 - Use str_subset to extract the first 16 letters 
 - What is the 10th letter?  Use `str_length()`to extract the middle two character(s)

2. Using `stringr::sentences`, answer the following.

 * How many sentences contain the word "green"?
 * Which sentence has the most characters? Hint: look at the help for `which.max()`
 * Convert all the sentences to uppercase.
 * What does `str_count()` do? 
 * Replace all fullstops with exclaimation marks. Hint: you'll need to use `\\.` and `\\!`

# Regular Expressions

* General language to describe patterns in strings.

*  Practice with `str_view()` 

```{r}
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_view(x, "an")
```

---

# Any character `.`

The next step up in complexity is `.`, which matches any character (except a newline):

```{r}
str_view(x, ".a.")
```

---

# Escape!

* How do we search for a literal dot `.` ?
* `\` is the character to escape 
* In R, we need to type two backslashes in a string.
* Therefore to search for a dot we need to use `\\.`

For example, to find the phrase `a.c`

```{r}
str_view(c("abc", "a.c", "bef"), "a\\.c")
```

---

# Escape escape!

* How do we search for a backslash `\`?
* Well we need to escape it.
* `\\\\`


```{r}
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear", "plum\\peach")
str_view(x, "\\\\")
```

---

# Anchors `r emo::ji("anchor")`

* By default, regular expressions will match any part of a string.
* We can anchor the regular expression to match from the start or end of the string. 
* `^` to match the start of the string.

```{r}
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_view(x, "^a")
```

---

# Anchors `r emo::ji("anchor")`

* By default, regular expressions will match any part of a string.
* We can anchor the regular expression to match from the start or end of the string. 
* `$` to match the end of the string.

```{r}
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_view(x, "a$")
```

---

# Anchors `r emo::ji("anchor")`

* Putting it all together
* Use both `^` and `$`

```{r}
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_view(x, "^apple$")
```

---

# Character classes

There are a number of special patterns that match more than one character.You’ve already seen `.`, which matches any character apart from a newline. 

* `\d` or `[0-9]`: matches any digit.
* `[a-z]`: any letter of the alphabet.
* `\s:` matches any whitespace (e.g. space, tab, newline).
* `[abc]`: matches a, b, or c.
* `[^abc]`: matches anything except a, b, or c.

Remember, to create a regular expression containing `\d` or `\s`, you’ll need to escape the `\` for the string, so you’ll type `\\d` or `\\s`.

```{r}
x <- c("apple1", "apple2", "apple", "banana")
str_view(x, "apple[0-9]")
```

---

# Repetition

We can also look for how many times a pattern matches:

* ?: 0 or 1
* +: 1 or more
* *: 0 or more
* {n}: exactly n
* {n, }: n or more
* {, m}: at most m
* {n, m}: between n and m

```{r}
x <- c("colour", "color", "colours")
str_view(x, "colo(u)?r")
```

---

# Grouping and backreferences

```{r}
str_view(fruit, "(..)\\1", match = TRUE)
```

---

# Exercises

Using `stringr::words`, create regular expressions that find all words that:

1. Start with “y”.
2. End with “x”
3. Are exactly three letters long. (Don’t cheat by using `str_length()`!)
4. Have seven letters or more.
5. Start with a vowel.
6. That only contain consonants. (Hint: thinking about matching “not” - vowels.)
7. End with ed, but not with eed.
8. End with ing or ise.
9. Contains consecutive triple vowels. (e.g "iou")

You might want to use the match argument to `str_view()` to show only the matching or non-matching words. Or use `str_subset()`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
str_view(words, pattern = "^ab", match = TRUE)
```
or
```{r, eval = FALSE}
str_subset(words, "^ab")
```
