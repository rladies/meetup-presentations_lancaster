# dplyr and Tidyverse

To access the datasets, help pages, and functions that we will use tonight, load the tidyverse by running this code:

```{r install tidyverse, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

```{r load libraries, message=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
```

```{r, out.width = "250px", fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/hex-dplyr.png")
```

---

# The Data `r emo::ji("airplane")`

* All flights that departed from New York City in 2013.

```{r load data}
library("nycflights13")
library("tidyverse")
```

Typing `flights` will print out the data in our console.
```{r flights print, eval = FALSE}
flights
```

Using a question mark opens the help page.
```{r flights info, eval = FALSE}
?flights
```

Using the `View()` function opens the data in a new tab.
```{r flights view, eval = FALSE}
View(flights)
```

# The big 5 dplyr verbs

* Pick observations by their values: `filter()`.
* Reorder the rows: `arrange()`.
* Pick variables by their names: `select()`.
* Create new variables with functions of existing variables: `mutate()`.
* Collapse many values down to a single summary: `summarise()`.

### `function(dataframe, options)`

---

# `filter()`

`filter()` allows you to subset observations based on their values. 

Let's say we want to select all the rows for for flights which departed on 1st January.

--

```{r filter jan1st}
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```

--

```{r saving filter results}
jan1 = filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```

---

# Making comparisons

| Symbol | Name |
|--------|--------------------------|
| > | greater than |
| >= | greater than or equal to |
| < | less than |
| <= | less than or equal to |
| == | is equal to |
| != | is not equal to |

Careful!
```{r equals, warning = TRUE, message = TRUE, error = TRUE}
filter(flights, month = 1)
```

---

# Logical operators

| Symbol | Name |
|--------|------|
| &      | and |
| I      | or |
| !      | not |

Let's find all the flights that occured in Autumn `r  emo::ji("maple_leaf")`. 

```{r or, eval = FALSE}
filter(flights, month == 9 | month == 10 |  month == 11 )
```


```{r in}
autumn <- filter(flights, month %in% c(10, 11, 12))
```

---

# Missing values

If you want to determine if a value is missing, use `is.na()`:
```{r is na}
x = NA
is.na(x)
```

 
`filter()` only includes rows where the condition is `TRUE`; it excludes both `FALSE` and `NA` values. If you want to preserve missing values, ask for them explicitly:

```{r is na filter}
filter(flights, dep_delay > 400 | is.na(dep_delay))
```

---

# `filter()` excercises

1. Find all flights that:
  * Had an arrival delay of two or more hours
  * Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)
  * Were operated by United, American, or Delta
  * Departed in summer (July, August, and September)
  * Arrived more than two hours late, but didn’t leave late
  * Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight
  * Departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive)

2. Another useful dplyr filtering helper is `between()`. What does it do? Can you use it to simplify the code needed to answer the previous challenges?

3. How many flights have a missing `dep_time`? What other variables are missing? What might these rows represent?

---

# `arrange()`

`arrange()` works similarly to `filter()` except that instead of selecting rows, it changes their order.

```{r asc}
arrange(flights, year, month, day)
```

---

# `desc()`
Use `desc()` to re-order by a column in descending order:
```{r desc}
arrange(flights, desc(dep_delay))
```

---
# `arrange()` excercises

1. Sort flights to find the most delayed flights. Find the flights that left earliest.

2. Sort flights to find the fastest flights.

3. Which flights travelled the longest? Which travelled the shortest?

4. How could you use `arrange()` to sort all missing values to the start? (Hint: use `is.na()`).

---

# `select()` 

* Some datasets have many columns
* `select()` allows you to rapidly zoom in on a useful a subset

```{r selecting}
select(flights, year, month, day)
```

---
# `select()`

```{r more selecting}
select(flights, year:day)
```
---
# `select()`

```{r even more selecting}
select(flights, -(year:day))
```

---

# Helper functions

There are a number of helper functions you can use within `select()`:

* `starts_with("abc")`: matches names that begin with “abc”.

* `ends_with("xyz")`: matches names that end with “xyz”.

* `contains("ijk")`: matches names that contain “ijk”.

* `matches("(.)\\1")`: selects variables that match a regular expression. This one matches any variables that contain repeated characters.

* `num_range("trial", 1:3)`: matches trial1, trial2 and trial3.

See `?select` for more details.

---

# `select()` excercises

1. Brainstorm as many ways as possible to select `dep_time`, `dep_delay`, `arr_time`, and `arr_delay` from flights.

2. What happens if you include the name of a variable multiple times in a `select()` call?

3. What does the `one_of()` function do? Why might it be helpful in conjunction with this vector?
  ```{r one_of, eval = FALSE}
  vars <- c("year", "month", "day", "dep_delay", "arr_delay")
  ```

4. Does the result of running the following code surprise you? How do the select helpers deal with case by default? How can you change that default?

  ```{contains ignore.case}
  select(flights, contains("TIME"))
```

---

# `mutate()`

* `mutate()` creates new columns that are functions of existing columns. Useful!

* `mutate()` always adds columns to the end of the dataset. So let's make a smaller dataset first.

```{r small}
flights_sml = select(flights, 
  ends_with("delay"), 
  distance, 
  air_time
)

flights_sml
```

---
# `mutate()`

```{r mutate gain}
mutate(flights_sml,
  gain = dep_delay - arr_delay,
  speed = (distance / air_time) * 60
)
```

---

# `mutate()`

Note that you can refer to columns that you’ve just created:

```{r mutate referal}
mutate(flights_sml,
  gain = dep_delay - arr_delay,
  hours = air_time / 60,
  gain_per_hour = gain / hours
)
```


---
# Useful functions with `mutate()`

* Arimethemic:  operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`. These are all vectorised, using the so called “recycling rules”.  E.g  `air_time / 60`

* Modular arithmetic: `%/%` (integer division) and `%%` (remainder) Modular arithmetic is a handy tool because it allows you to break integers up into pieces. For example, in the flights dataset, you can compute hour and minute from dep_time with:

```{r, modular}
transmute(flights,
  dep_time,
  hour = dep_time %/% 100,
  minute = dep_time %% 100
)
```

---
# Useful functions with `mutate()`

* Logs: `log()`, `log2()`, `log10()`.

* Offsets: `lead()` and `lag()` allow you to refer to leading or lagging values. This allows you to compute running differences (e.g. `x - lag(x)`). 

* Cumulative and rolling aggregates: R provides functions for running sums, products, mins and maxes: `cumsum()`, `cumprod()`, `cummin()`, `cummax()`; and dplyr provides `cummean()` for cumulative means.

* Logical comparisons, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `!=`, and `==`.

* Ranking: `min_rank()` and it's variants. See `?min_rank` 

---

# `mutate()` excercises

1. Create some of your own new columns using the `mutate()` function.

2. Currently `dep_time` and `sched_dep_time` are convenient to look at, but hard to compute with because they’re not really continuous numbers. Convert them to a more convenient representation of number of minutes since midnight.

3. Compare air_time with `arr_time - dep_time`. What do you expect to see? What do you see? What do you need to do to fix it?

4. Compare `dep_time`, `sched_dep_time`, and `dep_delay`. How would you expect those three numbers to be related?

5. Find the 10 most delayed flights using a ranking function. How do you want to handle ties? Carefully read the documentation for `min_rank()`.

6. What does `1:3 + 1:10` return? Why?

---

# `summarise()`

* The last key verb is `summarise()`. It collapses a data frame to a single row:

```{r summarise}
summarise(flights, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```


---
# `summarise()`

`summarise()` is not terribly useful unless we pair it with `group_by()`. 

```{r summarise grouped}
by_month = group_by(flights, month)
summarise(by_month, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```


---

# Combining multiple operations

Imagine that we want to explore the relationship between the distance and average delay for each destination. 

```{r pipe1, eval = FALSE}
by_dest = group_by(flights, dest)
delay = summarise(by_dest,
  total = n(),
  dist = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE),
  delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
)
delay = filter(delay, total > 20, dest != "HNL")
```
There are three steps to prepare this data:

* Group flights by destination.
* Summarise to compute distance, average delay, and number of flights.
* Filter to remove noisy points and Honolulu airport

This code is a little frustrating to write!

---

# Pipe! `%>%`
There’s another way to tackle the same problem with the pipe, `%>%`:

```{r pipe2}
delays = flights %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  summarise(
    count = n(),
    dist = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE),
    delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  filter(count > 20, dest != "HNL")
```

* Easier to read
* No unnecessary data frames
* Pronouce `%>%` as "then"
---

# Missing values

You may have wondered about the `na.rm` argument we used earlier.
What happens if we don’t set it?

```{r no rm.na}
flights %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(dep_delay))
```

---

# Missing values

Luckily, we can use the `na.rm` to tell `mean()` to ignore any `NA`s in the calculation.

```{r na.rm}
flights %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

---

# Missing values

Or, we could filter the dataset to remove the `NA`s before doing the calculation.

```{r missing values summaries}
not_cancelled <- flights %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(arr_delay))

not_cancelled
```
---

# Useful summary functions

* Counts: `n()`, `n_distinct()`
* Location: `mean()`, `median()`
* Spread:  `sd(x)`, `IQR(x)`
* Rank: `min(x)`, `quantile(x, 0.25)`, `max(x)`

Note: Counts are so useful that dplyr provides a simple helper if all you want is a count.

E.g. 
```{r count}
count(flights, dest)
```
---

# Useful summary functions

## Averages
* `mean()`
* `median()`

# Useful summary functions

## Spread

```{r spread}
not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  summarise(distance_sd = sd(distance)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(distance_sd))
```
---

#Grouping by multiple variables

When you group by multiple variables, each summary peels off one level of the grouping. That makes it easy toprogressively roll up a dataset:

```{r group by multiple}
daily <- group_by(flights, year, month, day)
per_day   <- summarise(daily, flights = n())
head(per_day)
```

---

# `summarise()` excercises

1. Brainstorm at least 5 different ways to assess the typical delay characteristics of a group of flights. Consider the following scenarios:
  * A flight is 15 minutes early 50% of the time, and 15 minutes late 50% of the time.
  * A flight is always 10 minutes late.
  * A flight is 30 minutes early 50% of the time, and 30 minutes late 50% of the time.
  * 99% of the time a flight is on time. 1% of the time it’s 2 hours late.
  * Which is more important: arrival delay or departure delay?

2. Come up with another approach that will give you the same output as `not_cancelled %>% count(dest)` and `not_cancelled %>% count(tailnum, wt = distance)` (without using `count()`).

3. Our definition of cancelled flights (`is.na(dep_delay) | is.na(arr_delay)` ) is slightly suboptimal. Why? Which is the most important column?

4. Look at the number of cancelled flights per day. Is there a pattern? Is the proportion of cancelled flights related to the average delay?

5. Which carrier has the worst delays? Challenge: can you disentangle the effects of bad airports vs. bad carriers? Why/why not? (Hint: think about `flights %>% group_by(carrier, dest) %>% summarise(n())`)

6. What does the sort argument to count() do. When might you use it?

---

# Grouped mutates and filters
Grouping is most useful in conjunction with `summarise()`, but you can also do convenient operations with `mutate()` and `filter()`:

Find the worst members of each group:
```{r worst members}
flights %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>%
  filter(rank(desc(arr_delay)) < 10)
```

---
# Grouped mutates and filters
Find all groups bigger than a threshold:
```{r popular}
popular_dests <- flights %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  filter(n() > 365)
```

Standardise to compute per group metrics:

```{r standardise}
popular_dests %>% 
  filter(arr_delay > 0) %>% 
  mutate(prop_delay = arr_delay / sum(arr_delay)) %>% 
  select(year:day, dest, arr_delay, prop_delay)
```

---
 
# Excercises

1. Which plane (tailnum) has the worst on-time record?

2. What time of day should you fly if you want to avoid delays as much as possible?

3. For each destination, compute the total minutes of delay. For each flight, compute the proportion of the total delay for its destination.

4. Delays are typically temporally correlated: even once the problem that caused the initial delay has been resolved, later flights are delayed to allow earlier flights to leave. Using lag(), explore how the delay of a flight is related to the delay of the immediately preceding flight.

5. Look at each destination. Can you find flights that are suspiciously fast? (i.e. flights that represent a potential data entry error). Compute the air time a flight relative to the shortest flight to that destination. Which flights were most delayed in the air?

6. Find all destinations that are flown by at least two carriers. Use that information to rank the carriers.

7. For each plane, count the number of flights before the first delay of greater than 1 hour.
