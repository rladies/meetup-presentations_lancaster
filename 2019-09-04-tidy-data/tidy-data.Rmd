# Tidyverse

This session will focuss on the `tidyr` package, which is a member of core tidyverse:

```{r install tidyverse, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

```{r load libraries, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
```

---

# Tidy Data

The same data set can be represented in multiple ways

```{r t1}
table1
```


---

# Tidy Data

The same data set can be represented in multiple ways

```{r t3}
table3
```

---

# Tidy Data

The same data set can be represented in multiple ways

```{r t4a}
table4a
```


---

# Tidy Data

The same data set can be represented in multiple ways

```{r t4b}
table4b
```

---

# Tidy Data

There are many ways to represent the same data set, however they are not equally easy to use. When we are using `tidyverse`, the tidy dataset will be easier to work with.

A data set is **tidy** if:

* Each variable has its own column;
* Each observation has its own row;
* Each value has its own cell.

```{r, out.width = "750px", fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tidy-data-rules.png")
```

Only `table1` was tidy.

---

# Tidy Data

Tidy data is advantageous:

* It's often good to be consistent anyway...
* Allows R's vectorised nature to be exploited easily.

`dplyr` and `ggplot2`, and all the other packages in the tidyverse are designed to work with tidy data

---

# `table1` Examples


```{r table1examples, echo=TRUE}
# Compute rate per 10,000
table1 %>% 
  mutate(rate = cases / population * 10000)
```

---

# `table1` Examples

```{r table1examples2, echo=TRUE}
# Compute cases per year
table1 %>% 
  count(year, wt = cases)
```

---
# `table1` Examples

```{r table1examples3, echo=TRUE}
# Visualise changes over time
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(table1, aes(year, cases)) + 
  geom_line(aes(group = country), colour = "grey50") + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = country))
```

---
# Spreading and Gathering

Often, data is not `tidy`. This is probably because the person analysing the data, did not construct the data set. So we need to tidy!

The first step is always to figure out what the variables and observations are. The second step is to resolve one of two common problems:

* One variable might be spread across multiple columns.

* One observation might be scattered across multiple rows.

To fix these problems, you’ll need the two most important functions in tidyr: `gather()` and `spread()`.

---
# Gathering

**Common problem:** a dataset where some of the column names are not names of variables, but values of a variable. 

```{r table4a_untidy}
table4a
```

table4a: the column names 1999 and 2000 represent values of the year variable, and each row represents two observations, not one.

---

# Gathering

To tidy a dataset like this, we need to gather those columns into a new pair of variables. To describe that operation we need three parameters:

* The set of columns that represent values, not variables. In this example, those are the columns 1999 and 2000.

* The name of the variable whose values form the column names. We call that the **key**, and here it is year.

* The name of the variable whose values are spread over the cells. We call that **value**, and here it’s the number of cases.

---
# Gathering

Together those parameters generate the call to `gather()`

```{r gathering}
table4a %>% 
  gather(`1999`, `2000`, key = "year", value = "cases")
```


---

# Gathering

In the final result, the gathered columns are dropped, and we get new key and value columns. Otherwise, the relationships between the original variables are preserved.

```{r gather_pic, out.width = "750px", fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/gather.png")
```

---
# Spreading

Spreading is the opposite of gathering. You use it when an observation is scattered across multiple rows. 

```{r table2_untidy}
table2
```

table2: an observation is a country in a year, but each observation is spread across two rows.

---

# Spreading

To tidy this up, we first analyse the representation in similar way to `gather()`. This time, however, we only need two parameters:

* The column that contains variable names, the key column. Here, it’s type.

* The column that contains values from multiple variables, the value column. Here it’s count.

---
# Spreading

Once we’ve figured that out, we can use `spread()`:

```{r spread}
table2 %>%
    spread(key = type, value = count)
```

---
# Spreading

`spread()` and `gather()` are complements: 

* `gather()` makes wide tables narrower and longer; 
* `spread()` makes long tables shorter and wider.

```{r spread_pic, out.width = "750px", fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/spread.png")
```
---

# Exercises

1) Why are gather() and spread() not perfectly symmetrical? Consider the following example:


```{r ex3, eval = F}    
stocks <- tibble(
  year   = c(2015, 2015, 2016, 2016),
  half  = c(   1,    2,     1,    2),
  return = c(1.88, 0.59, 0.92, 0.17)
)
stocks %>% 
  spread(year, return) %>% 
  gather("year", "return", `2015`:`2016`)
```

Both `spread()` and `gather()` have a convert argument. What does it do?

---

# Exercises Continuted

2) Why does this code fail?

```{r spread2, eval = F}
table4a %>% 
  gather(1999, 2000, key = "year", value = "cases")
```

3) Why does spreading this tibble fail? How could you add a new column to fix the problem?

```{r spread3, eval = F}
people <- tribble(
  ~name,             ~key,    ~value,
  #-----------------|--------|------
  "Phillip Woods",   "age",       45,
  "Phillip Woods",   "height",   186,
  "Phillip Woods",   "age",       50,
  "Jessica Cordero", "age",       37,
  "Jessica Cordero", "height",   156
)
```

---

# Exercises Continued

4)  Tidy the simple tibble below. Do you need to spread or gather it? What are the variables?

```{r spread4, warning = F, message = F, eval = F}
preg <- tribble(
  ~pregnant, ~male, ~female,
  "yes",     NA,    10,
  "no",      20,    12
)
```

# Separating and Uniting

So far we have learned how to tidy `table2` and `table4`, but not `table3`. 

table3 has a different problem: we have one column (rate) that contains two variables (`cases` and `population`). 

To fix this problem, we’ll need the `separate()` function. 

We will also learn about the complement of `separate()`: `unite()`, which we use if a single variable is spread across multiple columns.

---

# Separate

`separate()` pulls apart one column into multiple columns, by splitting wherever a separator character appears. 

Take `table3`: 

```{r table3_ex}
table3
```

The rate column contains both `cases` and `population` variables, and we need to split it into two variables.
---

# Separate

`separate()` takes the name of the column to separate, and the names of the columns to separate into:

```{r separate}
table3 %>% 
  separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"))
```


---
# Separate

```{r sep_pic, out.width = "750px", fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/separate.png")
```


---

# Separate

By default, separate() will split values wherever it sees a non-alphanumeric character. 

If you wish to use a specific character to separate a column, you can pass the character to the sep argument of separate().

```{r sep_cont, eval=F}
table3 %>% 
  separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"), sep = "/")
```

---

# Separate 

The default behaviour in `separate()` is to leave the type of the column as is. 

In our example, it’s not very useful as those really are numbers. 

We can ask `separate()` to try and convert to better types using `convert = TRUE`:

```{r sep_type}
table3 %>% 
  separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"), convert = TRUE)
```

---

# Unite

`unite()` is the inverse of `separate()`: it combines multiple columns into a single column.

You’ll need it much less frequently than `separate()`, but it’s still a useful tool.

```{r unite_pic, out.width = "750px", fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/unite.png")
```

---

# Exercises

1) What do the `extra` and `fill` arguments do in separate()? Experiment with the various options for the following two toy datasets.

```{r ex_unit, eval = F}
tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e,f,g", "h,i,j")) %>% 
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three"))

tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e", "f,g,i")) %>% 
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three"))
```

2) Both `unite()` and `separate()` have a remove argument. What does it do? Why would you set it to FALSE?

3) Compare and contrast `separate()` and `extract()`. Why are there three variations of separation (by position, by separator, and with groups), but only one unite?

# Missing Values

A value can be missing in one of two possible ways:

* Explicitly, i.e. flagged with `NA`.
* Implicitly, i.e. simply not present in the data.


Let’s illustrate this idea with a very simple data set:


```{r missing_example}
stocks <- tibble(
  year   = c(2015, 2015, 2015, 2015, 2016, 2016, 2016),
  qtr    = c(   1,    2,    3,    4,    2,    3,    4),
  return = c(1.88, 0.59, 0.35,   NA, 0.92, 0.17, 2.66)
)
```

---
# Missing Data

There are two missing values in this dataset:

* The return for the fourth quarter of 2015 is explicitly missing, because the cell where its value should be instead contains `NA`.

* The return for the first quarter of 2016 is implicitly missing, because it simply does not appear in the dataset.


---

# Missing Data

The way that a dataset is represented can make implicit values explicit. For example, we can make the implicit missing value explicit by putting years in the columns:


```{r boxplot, eval = TRUE}
stocks %>% 
  spread(year, return)
```

---

# Missing Data

Because these explicit missing values may not be important in other representations of the data, you can set `na.rm = TRUE` in `gather()` to turn explicit missing values implicit:

```{r pipe2, echo=TRUE}
stocks %>% 
  spread(year, return) %>% 
  gather(year, return, `2015`:`2016`, na.rm = TRUE)
```

---

# Missing Data
Another important tool for making missing values explicit in tidy data is `complete()`:

```{r template}
stocks %>% 
  complete(year, qtr)
```

`complete()` takes a set of columns, and finds all unique combinations. It then ensures the original dataset contains all those values, filling in explicit `NA`s where necessary.

---

# Missing Data

There’s one other important tool that you should know for working with missing values. Sometimes when a data source has primarily been used for data entry, missing values indicate that the previous value should be carried forward:

```{r treatment}
treatment <- tribble(
  ~ person,           ~ treatment, ~response,
  "Derrick Whitmore", 1,           7,
  NA,                 2,           10,
  NA,                 3,           9,
  "Katherine Burke",  1,           4
)
```

---

# Missing Data

You can fill in these missing values with `fill()`. It takes a set of columns where you want missing values to be replaced by the most recent non-missing value (sometimes called last observation carried forward).

```{r obs}
treatment %>% 
  fill(person)
```

---

# Data Set

Hopefully you have your own data sets to try and `tidy`. 

If you don't, you can try and tackle the `tidyr::who` dataset. This contains tuberculosis (TB) cases broken down by year, country, age, gender, and diagnosis method. 

The data comes from the 2014 World Health Organization Global Tuberculosis Report, available at http://www.who.int/tb/country/data/download/en/.
