# Rmarkdown in RStudio

* YAML Header
    * Instructions for how to build the document
* Text
    * Can include parameters from the code
* Code chunks
    * Raw code (R/C/Python) that is run and the output stored/returned
    * three back ticks for starting code chunks, single for inline
        * next to the 1 key! 
    

* Uses markdown syntax but can include direct latex / html if rendering to those formats

# Short tutorial

1. Create and build the template Rmarkdown document.
2. Change the output to HTML, PDF, Word and view them.
3. Add a code chunk to draw a histogram of the speed variable from the *cars* object - don't include the code.
4. Add some text which displays the mean of the speed variable in the middle of a sentence.
    Remember single back ticks for inline.

Presentation:

1. Create a presentation (format is your choice)
2. Include the histogram of the speed variable as a whole slide graphic
3. Add the average speed as a bullet point at the top of the histogram.

# Advanced Features

* Latex headers
* Hacking slide templates (such as this one)
* Journal article templates \url{https://github.com/rstudio/rticles}
* Dashboards and interactive documents (shiny)
* Whole websites and books

      in_header: header.tex
      keep_tex: true
