# Creating date/times

There are three types of date/time data that refer to an instant in time:

* A __date__. Tibbles print this as `<date>`.

* A __time__ within a day. Tibbles print this as `<time>`.

* A __date-time__ is a date plus a time: it uniquely identifies an
  instant in time (typically to the nearest second). Tibbles print this
  as `<dttm>`. Elsewhere in R these are called POSIXct, but I don't think
  that's a very useful name.
  
--------  
  
* We're going to focus on dates and date-times.
* If you need to work with times, you can use the __hms__ package.
* You should always use the simplest possible data type.

---

# Creating dates

To get the current date or date-time you can use `today()` or `now()`:

```{r}
today()
now()
```

Otherwise, there are three ways you're likely to create a date/time:

* From a string.
* From individual date-time components.
* From an existing date/time object.

---

# Creating dates from strings

* Date/time data often comes as strings. 
* Helpers provided by lubridate. 
* Automatically work out the format once you specify the order of the component. 

```{r}
ymd("2017-01-31")
mdy("January 31st, 2017")
dmy("31-Jan-2017")
```

* You can also use unquoted numbers

```{r}
ymd(20170131)
```

---

# Creating date-times from strings

`ymd()` and friends create dates. To create a date-time, add an underscore and one or more of "h", "m", and "s" to the name of the parsing function:

```{r}
ymd_hms("2017-01-31 20:11:59")
mdy_hm("01/31/2017 08:01")
```

You can also force the creation of a date-time from a date by supplying a timezone:

```{r}
ymd(20170131, tz = "UTC")
```

---

# Exercises

1.  What happens if you parse a string that contains invalid dates?
```{r, eval = FALSE}

    ymd(c("2010-10-10", "bananas"))
```

1.  What does the `tzone` argument to `today()` do? Why is it important?

1.  Use the appropriate lubridate function to parse each of the following dates:

```{r}
    d1 <- "January 1, 2010"
    d2 <- "2015-Mar-07"
    d3 <- "06-Jun-2017"
    d4 <- c("August 19 (2015)", "July 1 (2015)")
    d5 <- "12/30/14" # Dec 30, 2014
```
---

# From existing date columns

Sometimes existing data you have will have dates in a character string, and you can use the functions mentioned above to convert the whole column into a date.  Note that any values which cannot be converted will instead become NA values.

```{r}
head(horror_movies)

horror_movies_formatted <- horror_movies %>%
  mutate(release_date = dmy(release_date))

head(horror_movies_formatted)
  
```


# From individual components

Instead of a single string, sometimes you'll have the individual components of the date-time spread across multiple columns. This is what we have in the flights data:

```{r}
flights %>% 
  select(year, month, day, hour, minute)  %>%
  head() %>%
  DT::datatable()
```

---

#  From individual components

Use `make_date()` for dates, or `make_datetime()` for date-times:

```{r}
flights %>% 
  select(year, month, day, hour, minute) %>% 
  mutate(departure = make_datetime(year, month, day, hour, minute)) %>%
  head() %>% DT::datatable()
```

# Extracting components

You can pull out individual parts of the date with the following functions
* `year()`
* `month()`
* `mday()` (day of the month)
* `yday()` (day of the year)
* `wday()` (day of the week)
* `hour()`
* `minute()`
* `second()`

```{r}
datetime <- ymd_hms("2016-07-08 12:34:56")

year(datetime)
month(datetime)
mday(datetime)

yday(datetime)
wday(datetime)
```

For `month()` and `wday()` you can set `label = TRUE` to return the abbreviated name of the month or day of the week. Set `abbr = FALSE` to return the full name.


```{r}
month(datetime, label = TRUE)
wday(datetime, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE)
```

We can use `wday()` to see that most of the horror movies were released on a Friday than any other days:

```{r}
horror_movies_formatted %>%
  mutate(wday = wday(release_date, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = wday)) +
    geom_bar()
```

---

# Rounding

Sometime we want to round the date to the nearest unit of time.

* `floor_date()`
* `round_date()`
* `ceiling_date()`

Say we want to plot the number of movies per year:

```{r, fig.height=150}
horror_movies_formatted %>% 
  count(year = floor_date(release_date, "year")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, n)) + geom_line()
```

---

# Exercises

1. Which is the most popular month for horror movies to be released?

```{r}
horror_movies_formatted %>% 
  count(month = month(release_date, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(month, n)) + geom_bar(stat="identity")
```

2. Using `dplyr::filter`, `dplyr::count`, and `lubridate::floor_date`, work out which month in 2016 has the second highest number of horror films released.
```{r}
horror_movies_formatted %>% 
  filter(year(release_date) == 2016) %>%
  count(month = floor_date(release_date, "month")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(month, n)) + geom_line() +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "month")
```
---



# Setting components

You can also use each accessor function to set the components of a date/time: 

```{r}
(datetime <- ymd_hms("2016-07-08 12:34:56"))

year(datetime) <- 2020
datetime
month(datetime) <- 01
datetime
hour(datetime) <- hour(datetime) + 1
datetime
```

Alternatively, rather than modifying in place, you can create a new date-time with `update()`. This also allows you to set multiple values at once.

```{r}
update(datetime, year = 2020, month = 2, mday = 2, hour = 2)
```

If values are too big, they will roll-over:

```{r}
ymd("2015-02-01") %>% 
  update(mday = 30)
ymd("2015-02-01") %>% 
  update(hour = 400)
```

You can use `update()` to show the distribution of flights across the course of the day for every day of the year: 

```{r}
flights_dt %>% 
  mutate(dep_hour = update(dep_time, yday = 1)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(dep_hour)) +
    geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 300)
```

Setting larger components of a date to a constant is a powerful technique that allows you to explore patterns in the smaller components.

# Exercises

1.  How does the distribution of flight times within a day change over the 
    course of the year?
    
1.  Compare `dep_time`, `sched_dep_time` and `dep_delay`. Are they consistent?
    Explain your findings.

1.  Compare `air_time` with the duration between the departure and arrival.
    Explain your findings. (Hint: consider the location of the airport.)
    
1.  How does the average delay time change over the course of a day?
    Should you use `dep_time` or `sched_dep_time`? Why?

1.  On what day of the week should you leave if you want to minimise the
    chance of a delay?

1.  What makes the distribution of `diamonds$carat` and 
    `flights$sched_dep_time` similar?

1.  Confirm my hypothesis that the early departures of flights in minutes
    20-30 and 50-60 are caused by scheduled flights that leave early. 
    Hint: create a binary variable that tells you whether or not a flight 
    was delayed.

# Time spans

Next you'll learn about how arithmetic with dates works, including subtraction, addition, and division. Along the way, you'll learn about three important classes that represent time spans:

* __durations__, which represent an exact number of seconds.
* __periods__, which represent human units like weeks and months.
* __intervals__, which represent a starting and ending point.

---

# Durations

In R, when you subtract two dates, you get a difftime object:

```{r}
# How old is Hadley?
h_age <- today() - ymd(19791014)
h_age
```

A difftime class object records a time span of seconds, minutes, hours, days, or weeks. This ambiguity can make difftimes a little painful to work with, so lubridate provides an alternative which always uses seconds: the __duration__.

```{r}
as.duration(h_age)
```

Durations come with a bunch of convenient constructors:

```{r}
dseconds(15)
dminutes(10)
dhours(c(12, 24))
ddays(0:5)
dweeks(3)
dyears(1)
```

Durations always record the time span in seconds. Larger units are created by converting minutes, hours, days, weeks, and years to seconds at the standard rate (60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, 24 hours in day, 7 days in a week, 365 days in a year).

You can add and multiply durations:

```{r}
2 * dyears(1)
dyears(1) + dweeks(12) + dhours(15)
```

You can add and subtract durations to and from days:

```{r}
tomorrow <- today() + ddays(1)
last_year <- today() - dyears(1)
```

However, because durations represent an exact number of seconds, sometimes you might get an unexpected result:

```{r}
one_pm <- ymd_hms("2016-03-12 13:00:00", tz = "America/New_York")

one_pm
one_pm + ddays(1)
```

Why is one day after 1pm on March 12, 2pm on March 13?! If you look carefully at the date you might also notice that the time zones have changed. Because of DST, March 12 only has 23 hours, so if we add a full days worth of seconds we end up with a different time.

---

# Periods

To solve this problem, lubridate provides __periods__. Periods are time spans but don't have a fixed length in seconds, instead they work with "human" times, like days and months. That allows them work in a more intuitive way:

```{r}
one_pm
one_pm + days(1)
```

Like durations, periods can be created with a number of friendly constructor functions. 

```{r}
seconds(15)
minutes(10)
hours(c(12, 24))
days(7)
months(1:6)
weeks(3)
years(1)
```

You can add and multiply periods:

```{r}
10 * (months(6) + days(1))
days(50) + hours(25) + minutes(2)
```

And of course, add them to dates. Compared to durations, periods are more likely to do what you expect:

```{r}
# A leap year
ymd("2016-01-01") + dyears(1)
ymd("2016-01-01") + years(1)

# Daylight Savings Time
one_pm + ddays(1)
one_pm + days(1)
```

Let's use periods to fix an oddity related to our flight dates. Some planes appear to have arrived at their destination _before_ they departed from New York City.

```{r}
flights_dt %>% 
  filter(arr_time < dep_time) 
```

These are overnight flights. We used the same date information for both the departure and the arrival times, but these flights arrived on the following day. We can fix this by adding `days(1)` to the arrival time of each overnight flight.

```{r}
flights_dt <- flights_dt %>% 
  mutate(
    overnight = arr_time < dep_time,
    arr_time = arr_time + days(overnight * 1),
    sched_arr_time = sched_arr_time + days(overnight * 1)
  )
```

Now all of our flights obey the laws of physics.

```{r}
flights_dt %>% 
  filter(overnight, arr_time < dep_time) 
```

---

# Intervals

It's obvious what `dyears(1) / ddays(365)` should return: one, because durations are always represented by a number of seconds, and a duration of a year is defined as 365 days worth of seconds.

What should `years(1) / days(1)` return? Well, if the year was 2015 it should return 365, but if it was 2016, it should return 366! There's not quite enough information for lubridate to give a single clear answer. What it does instead is give an estimate, with a warning:

```{r}
years(1) / days(1)
```

If you want a more accurate measurement, you'll have to use an __interval__. An interval is a duration with a starting point: that makes it precise so you can determine exactly how long it is:

```{r}
next_year <- today() + years(1)
(today() %--% next_year) / ddays(1)
```

To find out how many periods fall into an interval, you need to use integer division:

```{r}
(today() %--% next_year) %/% days(1)
```

---

# Exercises

1.  Why is there `months()` but no `dmonths()`?

1.  Explain `days(overnight * 1)` to someone who has just started 
    learning R. How does it work?

1.  Create a vector of dates giving the first day of every month in 2015.
    Create a vector of dates giving the first day of every month
    in the _current_ year.

1.  Write a function that given your birthday (as a date), returns 
    how old you are in years.

1.  Why can't `(today() %--% (today() + years(1)) / months(1)` work?

## Time zones 

The first challenge is that everyday names of time zones tend to be ambiguous. For example, if you're American you're probably familiar with EST, or Eastern Standard Time. However, both Australia and Canada also have EST! To avoid confusion, R uses the international standard IANA time zones. These use a consistent naming scheme "<area>/<location>", typically in the form "\<continent\>/\<city\>" (there are a few exceptions because not every country lies on a continent). Examples include "America/New_York", "Europe/Paris", and "Pacific/Auckland".

You might wonder why the time zone uses a city, when typically you think of time zones as associated with a country or region within a country. This is because the IANA database has to record decades worth of time zone rules. In the course of decades, countries change names (or break apart) fairly frequently, but city names tend to stay the same. Another problem is that name needs to reflect not only to the current behaviour, but also the complete history. For example, there are time zones for both "America/New_York" and "America/Detroit". These cities both currently use Eastern Standard Time but in 1969-1972 Michigan (the state in which Detroit is located), did not follow DST, so it needs a different name. It's worth reading the raw time zone database (available at <http://www.iana.org/time-zones>) just to read some of these stories!

You can find out what R thinks your current time zone is with `Sys.timezone()`:

```{r}
Sys.timezone()
```

(If R doesn't know, you'll get an `NA`.)

And see the complete list of all time zone names with `OlsonNames()`:

```{r}
length(OlsonNames())
head(OlsonNames())
```

In R, the time zone is an attribute of the date-time that only controls printing. For example, these three objects represent the same instant in time:

```{r}
(x1 <- ymd_hms("2015-06-01 12:00:00", tz = "America/New_York"))
(x2 <- ymd_hms("2015-06-01 18:00:00", tz = "Europe/Copenhagen"))
(x3 <- ymd_hms("2015-06-02 04:00:00", tz = "Pacific/Auckland"))
```

You can verify that they're the same time using subtraction:

```{r}
x1 - x2
x1 - x3
```

Unless otherwise specified, lubridate always uses UTC. UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) is the standard time zone used by the scientific community and roughly equivalent to its predecessor GMT (Greenwich Mean Time). It does not have DST, which makes a convenient representation for computation. Operations that combine date-times, like `c()`, will often drop the time zone. In that case, the date-times will display in your local time zone:

```{r}
x4 <- c(x1, x2, x3)
x4
```

You can change the time zone in two ways:

*   Keep the instant in time the same, and change how it's displayed.
    Use this when the instant is correct, but you want a more natural
    display.
  
    ```{r}
    x4a <- with_tz(x4, tzone = "Australia/Lord_Howe")
    x4a
    x4a - x4
    ```
    
    (This also illustrates another challenge of times zones: they're not
    all integer hour offsets!)

*   Change the underlying instant in time. Use this when you have an
    instant that has been labelled with the incorrect time zone, and you
    need to fix it.

    ```{r}
    x4b <- force_tz(x4, tzone = "Australia/Lord_Howe")
    x4b
    x4b - x4
    ```
