# Libraries and Datasets

```{r libraries, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(nycflights13)
horror_movies <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-10-22/horror_movies.csv")
```

* **lubridate** is not part of core **tidyverse**
* **nycflights13** has practice data. `r emo::ji("airplane")`
* **horror_movies** dataset comes from a previous #TidyTuesday. `r emo::ji("ghost")`

---

# Dates times

  * Time is a measurement system
  
  * Unfortunately, it's messy
  
    * How long is a month?
  
    * If I say in one years time, do I mean in 365.25 days?
    
    * Leap seconds??

---

# Let's laugh at other software & tell horror stories

  * Excel cannot display dates before the year 1900


  * Excel thinks 1900 is a leap year

  
  * SAS does not recognise the year 4000 as a leap year
  
---

# Creating dates

To get the current date or date-time you can use `today()` or `now()`:

```{r}
today()
now()
```

Otherwise, there are two ways you're likely to create a date/time:

* From a string.
* From individual date-time components.

---

# Creating dates from strings

* Date/time data often comes as strings. 
* Helpers provided by lubridate. 
* Automatically work out the format once you specify the order of the component. 

```{r}
ymd("2017-01-31")
mdy("January 31st, 2017")
dmy("31-Jan-2017")
```

---

# Creating date-times from strings

`ymd()` and friends create dates. To create a date-time, add an underscore and one or more of "h", "m", and "s" to the name of the parsing function:

```{r}
ymd_hms("2017-01-31 20:11:59")
mdy_hm("01/31/2017 08:01")
```

You can also force the creation of a date-time from a date by supplying a timezone:

```{r}
ymd(20170131, tz = "UTC")
```

---

# Exercises

1.  What happens if you parse a string that contains invalid dates?
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}

    ymd(c("2010-10-10", "bananas"))
    ```

2.  Use the appropriate **lubridate** function to parse each of the following dates:

```{r}
    d1 <- "January 1, 2010"
    d2 <- "2015-Mar-07"
    d3 <- "06-Jun-2017"
    d4 <- "29/02/2001"
    d5 <- c("August 19 (2015)", "July 1 (2015)")
    d6 <- "12/30/14" # Dec 30, 2014
```

---

# From existing date columns

* You can use the functions above to convert the whole column into a date.
* Any values which cannot be converted will instead become NA values.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
horror_movies %>%
  slice(1:5) %>%
  select(title:release_country) %>%
DT::datatable()
```

---

# From existing date columns

```{r horror_formatted}
horror_movies_formatted <- horror_movies %>%
  mutate(release_date = dmy(release_date))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
horror_movies_formatted %>%
  slice(1:5) %>%
  select(title:release_country) %>%
DT::datatable()
```


---

# From individual components

* Sometimes you'll have the individual components across multiple columns.
* This is what we have in the flights data:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
flights %>% 
  select(year, month, day, hour, minute)  %>%
  head() %>%
  DT::datatable()
```

---

#  From individual components

Use `make_date()` for dates, or `make_datetime()` for date-times:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
flights %>% 
  mutate(date = make_date(year, month, day))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
flights %>% 
  select(year, month, day, hour, minute) %>% 
  mutate(date = make_date(year, month, day)) %>%
  head() %>% DT::datatable()
```



---

# Extracting components

You can pull out individual parts of the date with the following functions
* `year()`
* `month()`
* `mday()` (day of the month)
* `yday()` (day of the year)
* `wday()` (day of the week)
* `hour()`
* `minute()`
* `second()`

---

# Extracting components

```{r}
datetime <- ymd_hms("2016-07-08 12:34:56")

year(datetime)
month(datetime)
mday(datetime)

yday(datetime)
wday(datetime)
```


---

# Extracting components

* For `month()` and `wday()` you can set `label = TRUE` to return name 

* Set `abbr = FALSE` to return the full name.


```{r}
month(datetime, label = TRUE)
wday(datetime, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE)
```

---

# Which day are horror movies released?

We can use `wday()` to see that most of the horror movies were released on a Friday than any other days:

```{r, fig.height = 4}
horror_movies_formatted %>%
  mutate(wday = wday(release_date, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = wday)) +
    geom_bar()
```

---

# Rounding

Sometime we want to round the date to the nearest unit of time.

- `round_date(d, unit)`

- `floor_date(d, unit)`

- `ceiling_date(d, unit)`

In each of the above functions, `unit` should be one of `"second"`, `"minute"`, `"hour"`, `"day"`, `"week"`, `"month"`, or `"year"`.

---

# Rounding 

Say we want to plot the number of movies per year:

```{r, fig.height = 4, warning=FALSE}
horror_movies_formatted %>% 
  count(year = floor_date(release_date, "year")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, n)) + geom_line()
```

---

# Exercises

1. Store your birth date as a character variable i.e. `bday = "29/05/1990"`

2. Convert it into a date object using  `dmy()`

3. Which day of the week were you born on? Hint: Use `wday()`. Notice R returns the weekday as a number. To clarify this, set the argument `label` equal to `TRUE` inside `wday`. 

4. Which is the most popular month for horror movies to be released?

5. Using `dplyr::filter`, `dplyr::count`, and `lubridate::floor_date`, work out which month in 2016 has the second highest number of horror films released.

    ```{r, include=FALSE}
    horror_movies_formatted %>% 
    count(month = month(release_date, label = TRUE)) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(month, n)) + geom_bar(stat="identity")
    ```

```{r,  include=FALSE}
horror_movies_formatted %>% 
  filter(year(release_date) == 2016) %>%
  count(month = floor_date(release_date, "month")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(month, n)) + geom_line() +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "month")
```
